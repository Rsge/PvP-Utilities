# PvP-Utilities
This is a server side mod, adding lots of useful utilities for Minecraft PvP, be it modded or Vanilla.\
It was originally made for a private PvP project using FTB Trident and it's my first mod.

The mod can be downloaded on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pvp-utilities)
 
Features:\
(All modules can be turned off in the config)
* Limited amount of lives with configurable withdrawal reason (e.g. only if killed by player)
* Limited amount of playtime
* Configurable maximum XP-level
  (To nerf Last Stand enchantment)
* Extensive command logging
  (So the server owner can check which commands admins used)
* (Still buggy) autoclicker denial
  (Because before the dreaded combat update, he who clicks the fastest wins the fight)
